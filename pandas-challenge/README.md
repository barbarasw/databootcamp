# Pandas Challenge / PyCitySchools

Pandas Homework - PyCitySchools
By Raúl Flores / @raulfloresp

## Getting Started - PyCitySchools

The challenge is to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. We have access to every student’s math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The objective is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Outcome

The Outcomes is to generate different summaries and summarized tables of the PiCity Schools and their students. Details are:

### District Summary

The goal is to:
* Calculate the total number of schools
* Calculate the total number of students
* Calculate the total budget
* Calculate the average math score
* Calculate the average reading score
* Calculate the percentage of students with a passing math score (70 or greater)
* Calculate the percentage of students with a passing reading score (70 or greater)
* Calculate the percentage of students who passed math and reading (% Overall Passing)
* Create a dataframe to hold the above results
* Optional: give the displayed data cleaner formatting


### School Summary
Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
* School Name
* School Type
* Total Students
* Total School Budget
* Per Student Budget
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* % Passing Math
* % Passing Reading
* % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)
* Create a dataframe to hold the above results

### Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
* Sort and display the top five performing schools by % overall passing.

### Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
* Sort and display the five worst-performing schools by % overall passing.

### Math Scores by Grade
* Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
* Create a pandas series for each grade. Hint: use a conditional statement.
* Group each series by school
* Combine the series into a dataframe
* Optional: give the displayed data cleaner formatting

### Reading Score by Grade
* Perform the same operation like math score but now for reading score

### Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* % Passing Math
* % Passing Reading
* Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Scores by School Size
* Perform the same operations as above, based on school type

### Scores by School Type
* Perform the same operations as above, based on school type
