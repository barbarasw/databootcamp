## Introduction
For this project we have decided to work with information from movies as is something that we like and have interest in, and also because currently we have allot available spare time to watch a movie, so to make a better selection we have created this database. We were interested to have the ratings of the movies, that is why we use the database of reviews and qualifications of IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes, also we wanted to have a section where we can show in which streaming platform these movies were available. We follow the ETL process to acquire, transform and display our data, starting from the data extraction from databases available, then transforming our data with cleansing and adjustments and then saving this data in more readable and accessible format.


## Project Report
We have generated a detailed project report that can be found here:

## Data Sources
Data sources are related to movie datasets from kaggle, and they can be found here. 
https://www.kaggle.com/juzershakir/tmdb-movies-dataset
https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=es


## Database Design
The database design is illustrated here:

## Data Cleansing
Data cleansing was perfomed in Pandas and I have attached the associated Jupyter Notebook here:

## Database Schema creation
The database schema on Postgree SQL is detailed here:

## Conclusions
This was a fascinating project as it was our first encounter that we can do analysis and extraction from data in the real world and not just from academic content that is previously checked and reviewed for us the students. We think that things same really simple at the beginning but then you realize that you have make a mistake in the cleansing and transformation, that is a really common mistake that happens in the task of reviewing data. We found that we have need to make many adjustments to have the data according to our original design and that is not simple task as you need to clearly understand what you have, what you want and how to reference correctly the data to achieve that design that you have started with. Also, we found that there is much more extend to our analysis and that we can still contribute more to our database perhaps information from the directors, have more ratings from other sites etc... In conclusion ETL is a really powerful tool that we can use to analyze any data that we want from the web, but it only can be achieved if you put a lot of effort in understanding and cleaning your data.
