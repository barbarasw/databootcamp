# Python Challenge

Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie
By Raúl Flores / @raulfloresp

## Getting Started - PyBank & PyPoll Challenges

In this Python challenge, I created two Python Scripts:
- A Python script for analyzing the financial records of a sample company.I received a dataset of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.
- Python script that analyzes the votes for a small, rural town that needs to modernize its vote counting process. I received a dataset called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. and calculates each of the following:

## Outcome

The Outcomes that I generated for this challenge are:
- A new repository for the project called python-challenge. 
- This repository is cloned in my computer.
- Inside my local git repository, I create a directory for both of the Python Challenges. Folder names corresponding to the challenges: PyBank and PyPoll.
- Inside of each folder that I just created, added the following:
    - A new file called main.py. This is the main script to run for each analysis. The main.py is located in the PyBank and PyPoll folders.
    - A “Resources” folder that contains the CSV files I used.
    - An “Analysis” folder that contains my text file that has the results from my analysis - The file is called Output_File.txt for both PyBank and PyPoll.
    - I pushed the above changes to GitHub. User: raulfloresp

* ------------------------

### What is the PyBank Challenge?

To create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of “Profit/Losses” over the entire period
- The average of the changes in “Profit/Losses” over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

### What is the PyPoll Challenge?
To create a Python script that calculates each of the following:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
